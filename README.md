# Password Generator

## Description

I wanted to learn how to use and integrate what I learned in our course into creating an app and using it in a way to create a random password generator for those who needs help creating a really secured password. I learned that creating something like this seems really hard at first but it is a lot simplier than you think when you understand what you are doing and why you are doing it in that certain way.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The random password generator can be used to generate a secured and secret password for use. When openning the URL, it will take you to a page. Click on "Generate Password" to generate a password. You will be prompted with multiple questions regarding if you want to add in uppercase/lowercase/etc to your password. At the end of the prompts, it will generate a password depending on your answers to the prompts. This was created through mostly using Javascript to help build a password.
